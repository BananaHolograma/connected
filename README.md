# Requirements
üì¢ We don't currently give support to Godot 3+ as we focus on future stable versions from version 4 onwards
* Godot 4+

# ‚ú®Installation
## Automatic (Recommended)
You can download this plugin from the official [Godot asset library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2572) using the AssetLib tab in your godot editor. Once installed, you're ready to get started
##  Manual 
To manually install the plugin, create an **"addons"** folder at the root of your Godot project and then download the contents from the **"addons"** folder of this repository


# How to use
When you've been working with Godot for a while you discover that it has a fun node system to use. This plugin wants to help you implement a very easy minimalistic event system using nodes.

## ActionInteractor
This is the core of the plugin and we recommend not to alter its content since **it is only responsible for receiving and propagating actions**. You can use it in read mode as it contains the active emitters & listeners in your game in case you want to get their information.

Whenever you **disable or enable an ActionEmitter & ActionListener** this singleton emit the corresponding signal to report their connection or disconnection in case you want to react to these changes.


***The propagation is based on the `priority` property from `ActionListeners` who will react to this action so listeners with a higher priority will receive the action before the others.***

```python
## Retrieve all the active emitters
ActionInteractor.emitters
## Retrieve all the active listeners
ActionInteractor.listeners

## Available signals to connect
signal action_emitter_connected(action_emitter: ActionEmitter)
signal action_emitter_disconnected(action_emitter: ActionEmitter)
signal action_listener_connected(action_listener: ActionListener)
signal action_listener_disconnected(action_listener: ActionListener)

## A normal connection to a Godot signal
ActionInteractor.action_emitter_disconnected.connect(##...)
```


## ActionEmitter
Its sole purpose is to send actions to the singleton `ActionInteractor`. This actions are defined by the provided `Action` class which allows you to create your own custom behaviours.

### Add via editor
It's easy as find the node and add to the scene tree:

![action-emitter-search](images/action-emitter-search.png)
![action-emitter-node](images/action-emitter-node.png)


### Add via script
```python
## Inside the node script you want to add the ActionEmitter, we use _ready as an example but could be in any other place
func _ready():
	var action_emitter = ActionEmitter.new()
	add_child(action_emitter)
```

### Available methods
#### send(action: Action)
Send an action to the `ActionInteractor`, the latter will propagate it to the active listeners in the scene tree. If the action is `disabled` this function will not send anything

```python
@onready var action_emitter: ActionEmitter = $ActionEmitter

func pressed():
	var action = Action.new()
	action_emitter.send(action)
```

#### enable() & disable()
Enable or disable this action emitter so that it cannot send actions to the `ActionInteractor`. 

### Signals
```python
signal emitted_action(action: Action)
signal canceled_action(action: Action)
```

## The Action class
This is the minimalist base class that this plugin uses to send and receive via the `ActionInteractor`. It was designed to inherit it and add new properties or resources as well as overwrite its functions as a "hook" to provide your own behaviors.

### Properties
```python
var id: String # If no value is provided, it generates a random unique ID
var priority := 1
var is_listened := true
var listened_by := []
var ignored_by := []

func _init(_id: String = _generate_random_id(), _is_listened: bool = true, _priority: int = 1):
	id = _id
	is_listened = _is_listened
	priority = _priority
```

`listened_by` and `ignored_by` can be used to add the category to which a listener belongs. If they are empty by default the action will be propagated to the available listeners in the scene tree. The `category` property on listener is case-sensitive and they need to be set on the editor property of this node. More information on [ActionListener][#actionlistener]

You can use the methods:

 - `add_listened_by_categories(categories: Array[String], overwrite: bool = false) -> void:`

 - `add_ignored_by_categories(categories: Array[String], overwrite: bool = false) -> void:`

For example:
```python
var action = Action.new()
action.add_listened_by_categories(["enemies", "towers"])
action.add_ignored_by_categories(["weapons", "player"])
```

### Hooks
If `before_emit()` returns a falsy value the `Action` will trigger the `canceled_action` signal and `after_cancel` hook will be called as a consequence. Feel free to override this functions but **make sure that the `before_emit()` return always a boolean value.**
```python
func before_emit() -> bool:
	return true


func after_emit()-> void:
	pass


func after_cancel() -> void:
	pass
```

In the next custom action example we create an imaginary skill action where we check if the target provided is water before emit
```python

class_name FireballAction extends Action

var current_target

## If the target selected is water type we cancel the action
func before_emit() -> bool
	return not target.type is Water:


func select_target(target):
	current_target = target


### Send the action with any emitter available
var fireball = FireballAction.new()
fireball.select_target(enemy)
fireball.damage = 150

action_emitter.send(fireball)
```

## ActionListener
This is the next most important node, wherever it is added in the scene tree it will listen to the actions of any `ActionEmitter` as long as the action is listened by the category selected or has no restrictions.

The `ActionListener` does not need to be added in the same hierarchy as an action emitter. The `ActionInteractor` singleton is responsible for propagating the actions to the appropriate listeners.

![action-listener-search](images/action-listener-search.png)

![action-listener-node](images/action-listener-node.png)

### Available properties
```python
@export var category: String
@export_range(1, 1000, 1) var priority := 1
@export var disabled := false:
```
### Available methods

#### enable() & disable()
Enable or disable this listener.

### Listen to actions
The way to listen for actions is connecting to the provided signal `listened_action(action: Action)` from this node. Every time an `Action` is successfully sent and the listener is valid to listen to it, you will be able to get it from this signal

```python
@onready var spell_listener: ActionListener = $ActionListener

func _ready():
	spell_listener.category = "spells" # So this listener only receive Actions where the property listened_by has this category
	spell_listener.listened_action(on_listened_action)


func on_listened_action(action: Action):
	## Do your stuff...

## If you know exactly that this listener will receive always a specific CustomAction you can type the parameter more precisely
func on_listened_action(action: SpellAction):
	## Do your stuff...
```
